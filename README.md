# PurchaseCart

## Introduction


This is a practice project of IMOOC online course. It is a simple purchase cart project. The index page shows a list of products. Users can click on each course to see detail infomation about the product.
Under each product, there are two buttons, click on the 'add' button will add the product into your cart. Click on the favorite button will add the course into your favorite list.
Go to your cart, you can delete any product in your cart. When you click on the settlement button, the page will show you how much money in total.
